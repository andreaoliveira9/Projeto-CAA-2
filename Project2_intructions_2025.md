```
II. PROJECT ASSESMENT (25 % of the final grade)
```
1. Report. The project is evaluated based on a submitted report/paper (IEEE Latex format). The work done
    by each student has to be explicitly specified.
    All project’s files (pdf and Latex files of the report, the presentation slides and the code implementing the
    algorithms) are submitted to the elearning.ua.pt page of the course unit in section SUBMISSION –
    PROJECT 2 in a compressed format having the following name: P2_CAA2025_XXXXX_YYYYY (where XXXXX
    and YYYYY are substituted by the student number of each student.

```
The report should contain the following:
 A short review of research papers related to your topic.
 A description of the data set you will be working with.
 A brief description of the machine learning method you will use. Don’t re-explain basics such as how
CNNs work, rather describe the properties of your approach.
 Train the model and put the results in your report.
 Describe successes and problems in your analysis.
 Submit the code you produced for the project.
```
